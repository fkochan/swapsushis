# swapsushi
Each folder demonstrates how to interact with the SushiSwap protcol on the Ropsten testnet.

If you want to use this repo, you'll need to add a `.env` file which has two variables (PK and RPC_URL, i.e. your private key and web3provider)

Once you clone the repo, navigate into the main directory and run `npm install`, then navigate into specific example dir and then run `node index.js`

This has only been tested on Ropsten...
