# swapsushi
Currently the index.js file demonstrates how to swap ETH for DAI on SushiSwap (Ropsten Testnet)

If you want to use this repo, you'll need to add a `.env` file which has two variables (PK and RPC_URL, i.e. your private key and web3provider)

Once you clone the repo, navigate into the project dir and then run `npm install`, then `npm start`

This has only been tested on Ropsten...
